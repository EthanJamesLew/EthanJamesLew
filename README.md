# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ethan Lew.

I'm a Cyber-physical Systems Research Engineer with a passion for building safe autonomous systems using formal methods and AI. Currently, I work at Galois, where we're innovating in the verification of high assurance cyber-physical systems operating in unstructured and uncertain environments.

🔬 My Interests: Signals, Noise, and Trustworthy Systems

* I find the interplay between signals and noise fascinating, especially when it comes to developing reliable systems in the face of uncertainty.
* I thrive in multi-disciplinary teams, collaborating with experts from various domains to deliver end-to-end solutions that make a real impact.


👨‍💻 What You'll Find in My GitHub:

* Projects centered around building safe and autonomous vehicles using formal methods and AI.
* Approaches and methodologies for verifying high assurance cyber-physical systems, particularly in unstructured and uncertain environments.
* Exploring Rust as a safe and fast language, especially with an eye for verification.
